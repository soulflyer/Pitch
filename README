Find Chord
----------

find-chord will identify chords from a set of midi notes. To see it in action compile test.clj
You will probably need to modify it to read notes from your keyboard.
Change this line :

(def kb (midi-in "nanoKEY"))

to match your keyboard type. You can find the necessary changes by typing (midi-in) in the repl.

There is a shell script included that gives a continuous output of the chords being played. Run this command (from the source directory)

tail -f  ~/.overtone/log/log.log  | ./output.sh
